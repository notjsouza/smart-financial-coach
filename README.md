# Design Doc

This web application is a personal finance tool designed to provide users with real-time visibility
into their spending habits. By connecting securely to bank accounts through Plaid, the app
analyzes transactions, detects recurring subscriptions, and generates AI-powered insights and
recommendations. Its goal is to help users understand their spending patterns, reduce
unnecessary costs, and discover personalized opportunities to save and budget more
effectively.

The frontend is written with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript for type safety, reduced
runtime errors, and improved maintainability. The backend is powered by serverless functions
on AWS Lambda, split into three main handlers: one for AI-powered financial analysis, one for
connecting and retrieving data from Plaid, and one for handling authentication flows through
OAuth. The infrastructure runs on AWS Amplify, which streamlines hosting, CI/CD, and
serverless management while scaling automatically based on usage.

Data integration is handled primarily through Plaid, which provides secure OAuth flows,
encrypted token storage, and standardized access to transaction histories, balances, and seller
information. For AI and machine learning, the system uses OpenAI’s GPT-4o-mini, which I
chose for its balance of cost and high-quality analysis.

The first core feature is the real-time financial dashboard, which integrates live banking data.
Transactions are retrieved automatically, cached locally for efficiency, and displayed on the
dashboard. The dashboard prioritizes user experience by incorporating loading states, graceful
error handling, and client-side encryption.

The second major feature is intelligent subscription detection, which relies on a hybrid algorithm.
This combines fuzzy pattern matching on merchant names and amounts, heuristic rules for
known subscription services, and machine learning techniques such as frequency detection and
confidence scoring. The system is designed for accuracy, matching recurring payments even
when charges fluctuate slightly.

The third feature is an optional AI-powered financial insights section, generated through a data
pipeline that categorizes and aggregates transactions, analyzes spending patterns on a rolling
30-day window, and identifies high-cost subscriptions. Recommendations are then generated by
GPT-4o-mini, with a rule-based fallback system ensuring functionality if the AI is unavailable or
switched off. Insights cover monthly spending analysis, optimization opportunities, subscription
management, and projected savings goals.

Going forward, I aim to move off the sandbox and into their production environment so that it
can access the user’s real banking data as opposed to mock data. That way, this application
can be used by real users to manage their financial data across multiple banks and receive
relevant financial advice on how to optimize their spending habits.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
